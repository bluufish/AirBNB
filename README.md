# AirBNB

Generaly Assembly project #1

AirBNB is an online marketplace which enables people to lease or rent out their homes while not requiring the property owners to have any formal training or a business license. This ease of entry into the market has created its own boom in short-term rental properties while also building up its own pile of legal issues. The goal of this project was to perform an analysis of the AirBNB market in Amsterdam using Excel for a hypothetical client who wanted to invest in property to rent out using AirBNB. 

Included in this project is the steps taken to clean and organize the data, a pre-analysis presentation and the finished Excel sheet with our summary. Each student was tasked with individually deciding their own criteria for success, thus we were each responsible for deciding objectives and business problems. Revenue each property generated was generated using a formula relative to the number of reviews received.

The data was gathered from publicly sourced AirBNB data available from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
